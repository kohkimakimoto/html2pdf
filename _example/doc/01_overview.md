# Overview

A CLI tool for generating PDF from HTML by using Lua script.

Html2pdf uses [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to generate PDF. Actually, Html2pdf is designed as a wrapper of the wkhtmltopdf command. But Html2pdf bundles the wkhtmltopdf binary, so you don't need to install wkhtmltopdf. Html2pdf works well in a stand-alone.
